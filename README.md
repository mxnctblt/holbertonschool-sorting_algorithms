# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description

Here are the Learning Objectives :
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Tasks

### 0. Bubble sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

### 1. Insertion sort

Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

### 2. Selection sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

### 3. Quick sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

### Also
In each task write in the file -O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
```
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case
```
